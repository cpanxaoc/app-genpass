NAME
    App::Genpass - Quickly create secure passwords

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    Quick summary of what the module does.

    Perhaps a little code snippet.

        use App::Genpass;

        my $foo = App::Genpass->new();
        ...

DESCRIPTION
    If you've ever needed to create 10 (or even 10,000) passwords on the fly
    with varying preferences (lowercase, uppercase, no confusing characters,
    special characters, minimum length, etc.), you know it can become a
    pretty pesky task.

    This script makes it possible to create flexible and secure passwords,
    quickly and easily.

    At some point it will support configuration files.
