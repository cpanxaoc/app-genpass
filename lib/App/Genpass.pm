App::Genpass - Quickly create secure passwords

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use App::Genpass;

    my $foo = App::Genpass->new();
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you've ever needed to create 10 (or even 10,000) passwords on the fly with varying preferences (lowercase, uppercase, no confusing characters, special characters, minimum length, etc.), you know it can become a pretty pesky task.

This script makes it possible to create flexible and secure passwords, quickly and easily.

At some point it will support configuration files.
